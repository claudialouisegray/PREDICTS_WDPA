This folder contains the R scripts used to run the analyses in Gray, Hill et al. "Local biodiversity is higher inside than outside terrestrial protected areas worldwide". 

All scripts in this folder use the function ModelSelect_PA
The DATA_PREP scripts should be run before the analysis scripts. 

These analyses correspond to the section titled "Does the effect of protection vary with land use, latitudinal zone and taxonomic group?"

LUPA_analysis_3 contains the analysis carried out using the land use variable with all eight levels (Fig 3). 
LUPA_analysis_8 contains the analysis carried out using the land use variable with three levels, i.e. including taxon, land use intensity and latitudinal zone (Fig S2).

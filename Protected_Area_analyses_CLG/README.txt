This folder contains the R scripts used to run the analyses in Gray, Hill et al. "Local biodiversity is higher inside than outside terrestrial protected areas worldwide". 

All scripts in this folder use the functions compare_randoms and model_select. 

Scripts with the name starting "Analysis_simple" are those used in the section titled "Do sites within protected areas have more biodiversity than sites outside?". 
Each script provides the analysis for a different response variable, abundance, community weight mean range size, species richness and rarefied species richness. 

For the analyses falling within the section "Does the effect of protection vary with land use, latitudinal zone and taxonomic group?" please see the folder titled "Land_Use_Protected_Area_analyses_SH". 

Scripts with the name starting "Analysis_simple_matchedlanduse" and "Analyis_AgeSize_matchedlanduse"  are those used in the section titled "What is the effect of protection when sites are matched by land use?"
Scripts with the name starting "Analysis LUPA" contain the models run and calculations of the effectiveness measure in section "How best to improve the effectiveness of the global protected area network?"
